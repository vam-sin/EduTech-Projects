## Project 5

Project 5 has three things to do.
1) Convert the image to text.
2) Extract topics from the text.
3) Give search results for those topics.

To convert the image to text, we use the Tesseract OCR Engine. To use this we need have the pytesseract wrapper installed. 
The second part can be achieved by using the LDA Algorithm. 
The third one can be completed by using the googlesearch library based in python.
